-- | Takes a number <n> and memory, and stores two new values in memory:
--   - the integer (n + 3) at location 100
--   - the boolean (n > 0) at location 500
--   Return the pointer to each stored value, and the new memory.
--   You may assume these locations are not already used by the memory.
